IMS (It Makes Sense) is a supervised English all-words word sense disambiguation (WSD) system. The flexible framework of IMS allows users to integrate different preprocessing tools, additional features, and different classifiers. By default, we use linear support vector machines as the classifier with multiple features. This implementation of IMS achieves state-of-the-art results on several SensEval and SemEval tasks.
